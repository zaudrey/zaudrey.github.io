          The Taiji software is an integrative multi-omics data analysis framework. It can be used as a standalone pipeline to analyze ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, single cell ATAC-seq or 
          Drop-seq data. However, the uniqueness and the power of Taiji really lie in its ability to integrate diverse datasets and use these information in a clever way to 
          construct regulatory network and identify candidate driver genes. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The design philosophy of the Taiji pipeline is focused on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Correctness: We only include reliable algorithms and make every effort to ensure the implementations are bug-free.</li>
            <li>Performance: We code algorithms from scratch when necessary to ensure the pipeline can scale to large datasets (thousands of samples at least).</li>
            <li>Convinence: Most analyses have multipe entry points, e.g., Fastq, Bam or Bed. The execution of the pipeline requires only a single command.</li>
        </ul> 
        <p> We achieve these at the expense of customization. This will be improved in the future.</p>
